# Datasets
We use 4 datasets in our study -- of which two are public and two are not. For two public datasets, we provide links from which you can download.
1. EBM, which you can obtain from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ebmsumcorpus/).
2. MeQSum, which you can obtain from [here](https://github.com/abachaa/MeQSum).

For BioASQ and CHQSumm you need to register for the datasets to get the access.
